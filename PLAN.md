# Planned Features List

- MC (Master of Ceremony)

  - **View MC duties.** See the MC duties you have to supervise.
    - View the tasks as checklists and communicate with your staffs on what has to be done.
    - Tick off your duties to communicate to the ODs that everything is as planned.
    - The duty list is time-synced, so it keeps changing as the day progresses. You can see the past and future agendas/duties though. Same applies to the OD duties.

- OD (One-Day Director)

  - **View OD duties.** See the OD duties you have to supervise, as well as the MC duties and the statuses to check with the MCs.

  - **Shift Schedule.** When you need to move the sessions around (e.g. an activity doesn't finish in time, or an activity have to be wrapped up earlier than expected), the OD can improvise and shift the time slot.

  - **War Room Dashboard.** Display the overview dashboard in the War Room, so ODs and MCs can work together.

  - **Dry Run Mode.** To prepare every staffs for the event and get them comfortable with the system, you can dry-run the event in Day 0 with the Dry Run mode.
    - This will show the summary on the main screen, and show the duty/task summary on everyone's phone screen just like it would on the real day.
    - The only difference is that this allows the OD to go forward and backward in time to discuss the agendas and duties in detail.

- Staffs

  - **Staff View.** Navigate quickly between the different views and sub-apps with intuitive touch controls and app view, designed to be used in chaotic hours.

  - **View Staff Tasks.** Multiple tasks can be linked to the MC duty, so the MCs can assign and delegate tasks to everyone in the team.

  - **Voice Chat.** Communicate with all staffs or with a select group. Select whom to talk to for quick communication.
    - **Send Voice Messages.** Handle async communication with small snippets of voice messages.

- **Staff Points and Rewards.**

  - Give points to staffs for accepting a MC/OD role and taking on tasks. Can be used to encourage new staffs to participate and take up new things.

- Dropbox Message Box

  - **Write short messages to others.** Write personal and kind words to staffs and attendees to thank them and preserve the memories in both online and offline events. This is especially useful in boot-camps or events that takes time to organize.

    - EventKit can generate a permalink to the message box, so you can keep it until the end of time. Generate customized slugs like `https://dropbox.ycc.in.th/ycc2/thank-you-joe` to keep it personal.

  - **Print thank you cards with QR codes.** If you wish to have a physical keepsake for your friends, EventKit can generate printable QR codes that you can give to others.
    - You can pre-generate a couple of cards and print them ahead of time, then take some time to write the messages once you're back home. EventKit can show in-progress messages and notify them once you're done writing.
